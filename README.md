# CPAY: The Simplest Crypto Wallet

## Project Overview

CPAY is a smart wallet designed to make crypto transactions seamless by enabling users to pay network gas fees using USDC instead of native tokens. Built on top of the Circle Paymaster, CPAY leverages Circle Paymaster to abstract away the complexity of gas payments, allowing users to transact on supported blockchains with just USDC in their wallet.

## Challenge Statement

**Enable end users to pay for gas using USDC**

Develop an application that enables users to pay network fees in USDC instead of native tokens by leveraging Circle Paymaster.

> As of 11 June 2025, Circle Paymaster supports Arbitrum, Avalanche, Base, Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon, and Unichain.

## Key Features

- **USDC as Gas**: Users pay transaction fees in USDC, no need to hold native tokens.
- **Smart Account Management**: Create and manage smart accounts with Circle Paymaster integration.
- **Multi-chain Support**: Works across major EVM chains supported by Circle Paymaster.
- **User-Friendly**: Simplifies DeFi and dApp interactions by removing the friction of native token gas management.

## Example Use Cases

- **DeFi Protocols**: Enable USDC as the default gas payment token for dApps like Lido, AAVE, etc.
- **Simplified Transactions**: Users can perform transactions in USDC or other tokens while network fees are paid from their USDC balance.
